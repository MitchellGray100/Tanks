JavaFX One/Two Player Tank Game

The game starts by having a tank at the bottom left and the top right. The tanks are controlled by seperate players.
The second tank can be controlled by an AI in one player mode. There is also a power up that spawns equidistant from both
tanks. There are 4 different power ups. Shield, which lets the player take an extra hit. Wheels, which makes the tank
move faster. Rockets, which makes the bullets move faster. Triple Cannon, which makes the tank capable of shooting more frequently.
Bricks prevent the player from going through the space they cover. There is the brick border which always spawns, but there are also
bricks that spawn in the middle of the map. These bricks are randomly generated and make the game have good replay value. The game
makes sure there is always a way to get to the other tank.
